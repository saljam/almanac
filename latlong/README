This is the JavaScript version of github.com/bradfitz/latlong

The Go code in this directory generates the javascript file with the
timezone location completely data embedded. To generate it again run
`make`.

See https://plus.google.com/u/0/+BradFitzpatrick/posts/XVyy1bAzkZd for some background on the original Go version.
